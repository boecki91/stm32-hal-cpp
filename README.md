# stm32-hal-cpp
Convenient C++ wrapper for the STM32 HAL library routines

# Usage
- Clone this repository into your project's 3rd-party directory or add it as a git sub-module:
```
git submodule add 'https://github.com/tomikaa87/stm32-hal-cpp.git' 3rdparty/stm32-hal-cpp
```
- Add the `stm32-hal-cpp/include` directory to your project's include search path
- Include the necessary headers, e.g. `gpio.hpp` for the GPIO API

Please keep in mind this library needs a C++11 compatible compiler.
